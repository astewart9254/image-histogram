# Image Histogram

*Exposure at a glance.*

## What Image Histogram is

**Image Histogram** is an image utility. Render RGB histograms for images in a folder as PNG overlays or sidecar files.

A folder of shots needs a quick exposure check.

Point it at a path, preview the plan if you want, then write the result next to the source or to `--out`.

## How to get it

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## Features

- RGB channels
- Sidecar PNG
- Folder batch
- Keeps originals

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
